"There exists a truth that all who bear this duty must understand. You are better. To be marked by the oath is to know that the world could not exist without your toils, for though you're of a dying people, you are, nonetheless, superior.<br><br>

Within the walls of his fortress, Hadrûnzhar's own had penned this guide. As you well know. It serves to remind the faithful, those who carry the oath, of their purpose.<br><br>

<strong>Firstly</strong>: Thou shall never enter the service of a lowborn. Yeomen are an exception, so long as it's a guild who carries the contract.<br><br>

<strong>Secondly</strong>: Thou shall not impair the great works of the Tyrant's own. Under no condition are you to take a contract that would directly interfere with Astrata's flock, nor are you to strike them down under any circumstance.<br><br>

<strong>Thirdly</strong>: Thou shall propagate the oath's prestige. For you are an individual of honour, centuries of service as you may have. Yet, you must not be open about your purpose. Discretion is everything, when in the employ of those who've been blessed by the Tyrant.<br><br>

<strong>Lastly</strong>: Thou shall not inform the rabble of one's oath, beyond what is absolutely necessary. You must destroy this tome, should it come at risk of falling into another's hands. For it is yours, and yours alone.<br><br>

To ignore any guideline, as written, is to put one's oath at risk. To stain your lineage and incur your kin's wrath. A blessed hunt, honoured one."]}
